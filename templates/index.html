                            <p>The Cool Ducks team has taken notice that climate change has been not only St. Louis but the world.
                                St. Louis' average temperature plans to rise more than 2 degrees this decade alone.
                                We are aware that warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air. This will eventually lead to
                                more severe rainfall within the St. Louis area if nothing is done.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local,
                                regional, and global climates is referred to as climate change. These modifications have a
                                wide range of impacts. Climate Change has been a major topic of discussion since the late 20th century. Human activities, notably fossil fuel burning,
                                have increased heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere and elevating Earth's average surface
                                temperature which can be seen in within the data since from the early twentieth century.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unfortunately, St louis has seen its fair share of the impacts of this global crisis which we are currently facing.
                                St Louis has seen numerous devastations from increased rainfall over the past few decades due to the rise in greenhouse
                                gas emissions and other human activities. This later would attribute to a wet fall and increase of moisture levels
                                within the soil of the basins of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, causing the rivers to flood at an historic high.
                                This event would go on to be known as the Great Flood of 1993. The Mississippi River peaked at 49.58 feet in St. Louis, the highest level ever recorded.
                                This devastation is responsible for nearly fifty deaths and over fifteen million dollars in damages. Despite the phenomenon, climate
                                change is still being an issue swept underneath the rug.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, how do we prove this? First, we had to come up with a system to provide the latest data of average temperatures throughout St. Louis history. Sadly, the only thing we could find was a PDF url that we could download to get the latest info. However, the PDF format did not hold us back and we found a way to utilize that file. We then took that data we found from their pdf containing the average temperature of St. Louis on a yearly basic from 1838-2017 and sorted through the data so we could compute the average temperature within each decade. We then used the formatted data and to create data visualizations charts which represent the increase of average temperature. Based on the interpretation of the graphs you could then conclude that the average temperature over the years has been on an incline and is currently at an
                                all-time high, which proves that the climate change crises is gradually worsening.

                                Climate change is a global health crisis that has the potential to undo decades of progress in health and development, to inflict widespread human suffering, to
                                exacerbate global healthcare disparities, and to jeopardize the environmental and economic systems that we rely on for survival. With all the information mentioned,
                                we hope this encourages you to make difference and choose better environmental decisions!
