						<strong class="">Overview</strong> <hr>
						<p>The Cool Ducks team has noticed that climate change is a major issue in St. Louis.
						St. Louis' average temperature to rise more than 2 degrees this decade.
						We know
						that warmer air holds more moisture than cooler air. This will in time lead to
						more severe rainfall in the area.</p>

						<p>
							A long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local,
							regional, and global climates is referred to as climate change. These modifications have a
							wide range of impacts. Climate change is an ongoing issue going on within the world. It has been
							a major topic of discussion since the late 20th century. Human activities, notably fossil fuel burning,
							have increased heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere, elevating Earth's average surface
							temperature, as seen in changes in the climate from the early twentieth century.
						</p>

						<p>
							Unfortunately, St louis has seen its fair share of the impacts of this global crisis we are currently facing.
							St Louis has seen numerous devastations from increased rainfall over the past few decades due to the rise in greenhouse
							gas emissions and other human activities. This later would later attribute to a wet fall and increase of moisture levels
							within the soil of the basins of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, causing the rivers to flood at an historic high.
							This is known as the Great Flood of 1993. The Mississippi River peaked at 49.58 feet in St. Louis, the highest level ever recorded.
							This devastation is responsible for nearly fifty deaths and over fifteen million dollars in damages. Despite the phenomenon, climate
							change is still being an issue swept underneath the rug.
						</p>

						<p>
						We took data we found from a pdf containing the average temperature of St. Louis over the past decades and cleaned through it so that the average
						temperature would align with the corresponding decade. We then used the clean data and used it to create graphs to visually represent the data patterns using
						python. Based on the interpretation of the graphs you could then conclude that the average temperature over the years has been on an incline and is currently at an
						all-time high, which proves that the climate change crises is gradually worsening.
						</p>

						<p>
							Climate change is a global health crisis that has the potential to undo decades of progress in health and development, to inflict widespread human suffering, to
							exacerbate global healthcare disparities, and to jeopardize the environmental and economic systems that we rely on for survival. With all the information mentioned,
							I hope this encourages you to make difference and choose better environmental decisions!
